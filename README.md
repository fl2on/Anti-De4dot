# Anti-De4dot

Anti-De4dot safeguards .NET binaries from De4dot decompiler, protecting intellectual property from unauthorized access. This tool is independent, requiring no additional modules or libraries. However, it's not foolproof and should be combined with other security measures.

## Features

- You can drop the application or write the path to the file.
- Random generation of type names: The code uses an instance of the 	"RandomNumberGenerator" class to generate an array of random bytes that are used to create unique type names.
- Use of "using" blocks: The code uses "using" blocks to ensure that objects are properly cleaned up after use and to free resources such as memory used by the "RandomNumberGenerator" instance.
